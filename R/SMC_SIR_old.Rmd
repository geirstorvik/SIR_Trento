Notebook for performing sequential Monte Carlo on SIR model 

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
x = read.csv("../data/data_covid19_lab_by_time_latest.csv")
x = 
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
